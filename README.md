LamTat-GPT - React + Tailwind mock ChatGPT clone

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm start

Notes:
- Login: test@demo.com / 123456
- Tailwind is configured. If tailwind CLI isn't available on your system, running `npm start` will still work because CRA with postcss will process CSS using the included config.
